# Hermes
### University of Edinburgh year 3 system design group project
Project Hermes is changing how delivery robots work. Instead of just delivering objects
from point A to point B, our system is an integrated, autonomous inventory management solution. It
is indeed capable of moving things around, but the movement itself is automated and optimised for
minimal energy consumption. The task of sorting items and remembering where they are is offloaded
from people to the server and robot network. It can be used in a factory or workshop environment.
